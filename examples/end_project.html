				<p>I haven't taken a traditional path to programming and tech. It was not a field that I envisioned myself entering when I was younger. Because of my extreme luck and dedication, I've learned how almost anything is possible with technology, how supportive and welcoming the tech community is, how I can help so many people, and how I can continually learn new things and constantly challenge myself. I've overcome every programming obstacle that has stood in my way and I'm looking forward to new challenges, to advancing my current skills, and to learning new ones with every project.</p>
