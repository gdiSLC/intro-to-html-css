From today's featured article

St Denys' Church is an Anglican parish church in the English market town of Sleaford. Churches have existed on the site since at least 1086, but the date of the present building's construction is unknown. The oldest parts are the tower and spire, which date back to the late 12th and early 13th centuries; the stone broach spire is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England. The Decorated Gothic nave, aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century. A new north aisle was added by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853, and the tower and spire were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning. Built out of Ancaster stone with a lead roof, St Denys' is furnished with a medieval rood screen and a communion rail, possibly by SirChristopher Wren, and has a peal of eight bells, dating to 1796. It houses several memorials, including two altar tombs for members of the Carre family, Sleaford's Lords of the Manor. AGrade I listed building, it is "remembered for the flowing traceryof its windows" according to the architectural historian SirNikolaus Pevsner. Worship services are still held at St Denys'.

Today's featured picture

Typical Filipino handmade brooms in Banaue. Brooms are cleaning tools consisting of fibers (often made of materials such as plastic, hair, or corn husks) attached to, and roughly parallel to, a cylindrical handle. In Asian countries there is often a distinction between a "hard broom" and a "soft broom", named for the types of fibers used. Soft brooms are made for sweeping the walls of cobwebs and spiders, whereas hard brooms are made for sweeping dirt off sidewalks.
